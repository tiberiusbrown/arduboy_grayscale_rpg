Start with Matthias in a clearing with no exit. There is a strange figure. Talk to him.
    Figure: Very soon will your path become known, Matthias..
Talk to him again:
    Figure: The time for the Return of the Ardu has come.
The strange figure is gone now. An exit in the clearing is now open. Go through it.
A warror is patrolling. Walk into him.
    Warrior: What? The Ardu boy! And yet to achieve full potential. Die now!

Teleport to the Matthias's home in his bed.
    Mother: Matthias! I heard you cry out. Was it another of those dreams?
    Matthias: I... I think so. But this one was different, mother. The figure... he spoke to me. Something about my path and... he said something about the "Ardu".
    Mother: The... Ardu?
    Mother: Are you sure?
    Mother: I mean... it was just a dream, dear son. Come along, the morning's getting on. I need you to go to Old Charlie and get some fish for tonight. A walk in the fresh air will ease your mind.

Walk to the village square. Take to Old Charlie.
    Old Charlie: Matthias! Good to see you, boy. How's your mother?
